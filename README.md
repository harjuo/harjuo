Hi, I'm Otto. I'm a software engineer at Symbio and this is my personal Github space where I have repositories mostly serving as exercises for me to develop my skills in different aspects of programming languages. I'm interested especially in Rust, data structures, asynchronous programming, multithreading and networking code.
